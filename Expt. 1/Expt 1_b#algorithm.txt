Step 1: START
Step 2: Declare required variables and also a function pointer 'ptrf'
Step 3: Get two integers 'p' & 'q', as user input
Step 4: Get a user input character 'operator'; of operation to be performed on the 2 numbers
Step 5: Using switch function, assign function pointer 'ptrf' the function corresponding to the input operator.
        If the user gives an invalid operator, then display appropriate message and wait for valid input
Step 6: Assign 'ans' variable the output of the function assigned to 'ptrf' with p & q as parameters to the function.
Step 7: Call the display function with 'ans' parameter to display the result after performing the required operation.
Step 8: STOP
